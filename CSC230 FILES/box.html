    Now the width of the visible box is 500 pixels (compare to 550 pixels in the

content-box model), and the total element widh is 540px. Many develop-
ers find the border-box model to be a more intuitive way to size elements.

It is particularly helpful for specifying widths in percentages, which is a
cornerstone of responsive design. For example, you can make two columns
50% wide and know that they will fit next to each other without having to
mess around with adding calculated padding and border widths to the mix
(although you still need to account for margins).

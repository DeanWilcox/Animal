    <article><head><h2>Low and Slow</h2>
    <p>Posted by BGB, November 15, 2016</p></head>
    <p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking
        technique called <dfn><i>sous vide</i></dfn>. In <i>sous vide</i>
        cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a
        water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the
        food to be cooked to. In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff
        Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q></p>
        <p><p>Next month, we will be serving <b><i>Sous Vide</i> Salmon with Dill
            Hollandaise</b>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before
            <time datetime="20161130">November 30</time>.</p></p>

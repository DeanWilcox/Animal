        <p>First, you’ll notice that the style rule that floats the span includes the
            width property. It is necessary to specify a width for a floated text element
            because without one, its box is sized wide enough to fit its content (auto).
            For short phrases that are narrower than the container, that might not be
            an issue. However, for longer, wrapped text, the box expands to the width
            of the container, making it so wide that there wouldn’t be room to wrap
            anything around it. Images have an inherent width, so we didn’t need to
            specify a width in the previous example (although we certainly could have).
            Floated inline elements behave as block elements.
            Notice that the margin is held on all four sides of the floated span text,
            even though top and bottom margins are usually not rendered on inline
            elements (see FIGURE 14-20 in the previous chapter). That is because all
            floated elements behave like block elements. Once you float an inline
            element, it follows the display rules for block-level elements, and margins
            are rendered on all four sides.
